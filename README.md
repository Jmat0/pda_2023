## Creditworthiness: Accurate detection for high-risk credit Applicants

### Description
Final project for my __Projects in Data Analytics for Decision Making__ class.

Credit risk assessment using various models in R (LR, RF, GLMNET, SVM, and more). The aim is to find the model that will correctly classify, with the highest probability, when a client is at risk of defaulting.

### Data
The dataset used contains 1000 observations, each representing a client from the bank. It contains various information such as the amount requested, the job occupation of the applicant, his/her marital status, and more.


### How to run the project
